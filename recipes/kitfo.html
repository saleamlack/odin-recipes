    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 and 1/2 pounds beef fillet well-trimmed</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon cayenne pepper</li>
        <li>2 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon anchovy paste</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon ground cardamom</li>
        <li>1/3 cup clarified butter or ghee</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Set out a large high-powered food processor. Make sure to trim all the silver skin and fat off the fillet and cut the fillet into large chunks. Place in the food processor.</li>
        <li>Add the cayenne, salt, anchovy paste, garlic powder, and cardamom. Pulse to chop the fillet into fine chunks. You can choose to stop with when the beef resembles 1/4 inch chunks, or chop smaller into ground steak.</li>
        <li>Once the texture is to your liking, melt the clarified butter and pour over the top. Mix the butter in by hand, do not pulse.</li>
        <li>Serve raw immediately, cover and chill, or pan-fry over high heat for 1 -2 minutes.</li>
    </ol>
